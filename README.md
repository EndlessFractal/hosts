# EndlessFractal/hosts

Retrieves a list of domain names from various sources and filters them to create a consolidated list of unique domains. The filtered list is then saved to a file called `hosts.txt`.

## Description

The script performs the following steps:

1. Reads from a list of URLs from which to retrieve domain lists.
2. Sends HTTP requests to each URL and retrieves the response text.
3. Parses the response text, filters out empty lines and comments, and extracts the domain names.
4. Stores the unique domain names in a set data structure.
5. Sorts the domain names in alphabetical order.
6. Retrieves the current date and time as the last update timestamp.
7. Counts the number of unique domains.
8. Constructs a header section with the last update timestamp and the number of unique domains.
9. Writes the header and the filtered domain names to the `filtered_hosts.txt` file.
